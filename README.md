# PersonalDotNetSite
My Personal Website in ASP.NET Core

# What isn't in here
- appsettings.json
- Client-side dependencies: I used npm for the client-sde dependencies, then manually copied them over to the lib folder, and deleted the duplicates

# How it's made
Built mainly using the outdated PluralSight course here:
